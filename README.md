# Genomic EDA Visualization

An EDA-driven genomic data analysis project aimed at uncovering genetic patterns and variations, with results visualized via a Flask web interface.

## 🔬 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship under NSDC (Skill India) and focuses on analyzing genomic data to detect patterns, correlations, and anomalies using EDA techniques. The application presents interactive and static visualizations through a user-friendly web interface.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing of genomic CSV data
- Descriptive statistics and summary reports
- Interactive plots for gene expression and mutation patterns
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Web interface built with Flask for ease of access

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
